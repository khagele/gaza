My name is Kasper, 39 years old, living in Nijmegen, The Netherlands, with my wife and our three daughters.

On behalf of my in-laws — Ferial, Seria, Nivine, Ingram, Brahim, Rafiq, Sofiaan, Suhail, Zahia, Hiba, Bilal, and Zain — living in Nijmegen, Elst, and Utrecht, The Netherlands, I am asking for your help. They have many close family members in Gaza. Their father's and uncle’s siblings, uncles and aunts, cousins, and half-siblings all live there with their families.

We worry every single day. We know they are suffering from hunger and a lack of clean drinking water. At the same time, we see no hopeful perspective for what comes next as the situation is worsening rapidly.

We support them from here by sending money directly. This is used for clean water, food, medicine, fuel, and materials for tents, everything needed to keep our family and those around them alive for as long as possible.

By marking donations as alms (_Zakaat_ & _Zakaat al-Fitr_), they have already supported **65 other unrelated families**. Despite everything, that duty is sacred and they take care of the vulnerable within their reach.

Every contribution via the links below helps and directly impacts extending the lives of these people. **Thank you.**
